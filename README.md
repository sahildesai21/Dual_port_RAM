# Dual Port RAM (DPRAM) with ROM-Based Self-Test System

---

## Project Overview
This project implements a **basic on-chip memory subsystem** consisting of a **Dual Port RAM (DPRAM)** and a **Read-Only Memory (ROM)** along with supporting logic such as **address counters** and an **adder**.

The design demonstrates **independent read and write operations** using two address ports operating on **separate clock domains**, a concept commonly used in FIFO and buffer memory architectures.

---

## 🧠 Design Description
A **Dual Port RAM** provides two independent address ports.  
In this implementation:

- **Port A** is used for **write operations**
- **Port B** is used for **read operations**
- Read and write ports run on **different clock frequencies**

The **ROM** is pre-initialized with control data that:
- Provides an **offset value** to the adder
- Controls the **Write Enable (WEA)** signal of the DPRAM

This configuration creates a **self-testing loop** that verifies the correctness of memory access and data integrity.

---

## ⚙️ Functional Flow
1. ROM outputs offset and write enable signals
2. Up counter generates write address
3. Down counter generates read address
4. Adder combines input data with ROM offset
5. Modified data is written into DPRAM
6. Data is read back via second port to validate operation
